      <p>
        PUBG is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred
        players fight in a battle royale, a type of large-scale last man
        standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive.
        Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team
        of up to four people. The last person or team alive wins the match.[2]
        Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of
        the four maps, with areas of approximately 8 × 8 kilometres (5.0 × 5.0
        mi), 6 × 6 kilometres (3.7 × 3.7 mi), and 4 × 4 kilometres (2.5 × 2.5
        mi) in size.[3] The plane's flight path across the map varies with
        each round, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to
        eject and parachute to the ground.[2] Players start with no gear
        beyond customized clothing selections which do not affect gameplay.
        Once they land, players can search buildings, ghost towns and other
        sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor, and other equipment. These
        items are procedurally distributed throughout the map at the start of
        a match, with certain high-risk zones typically having better
        equipment.[2] Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as
        well.[2] Players can opt to play either from the first-person or
        third-person perspective, each having their own advantages and
        disadvantages in combat and situational awareness; though
        server-specific settings can be used to force all players into one
        perspective to eliminate some advantages.[4]
